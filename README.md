The platform showcases an interactive grid of movie trailers. Implicit user feedback, including trailer watch time and click data, are used to recommend new movies to users as they scroll. Six recommendation models have been implemented: two content-based filtering methods (k-nearest neighbour and k-means clustering), two collaborative-based filtering methods (matrix factorization and deep learning), a hybrid method combining recommendations from the former approaches, and a novel collaborative-based filtering method using a graph database.
